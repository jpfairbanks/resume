  abstract = {A matching is indecomposable if it does not contain a nontrivial contiguous
        segment of vertices whose neighbors are entirely contained in the
        segment. We prove a Ramsey-like result for indecomposable matchings,
        showing that every sufficiently long indecomposable matching contains
        a long indecomposable matching of one of three types: interleavings,
        broken nestings, and proper pin sequences.},
